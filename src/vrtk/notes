- update functions return whether we need further updates soon or if everything
  has stabilized and we're good. This way we won't have to busy-loop in non-VR
  situations.

- instead of exposing bounding volumes and letting the user decide if they need
  to send us events, expose a raytest and containment test so we can propagate
  the test to every widget if necessary, to implement coarse and progressively
  more fine colision detection, and letting each widget do that in the most
  natural and simple way internally.

- user "mouse" input is in the form of rays and 6D pos/rot. for the 2D case
  we'll generate rays perpendicular to XY, for hand-tracking we'll have both for
  pointing far away and for manipulating close by.

- instead of click events we have action events that go to the hovered widget
- hover events take both rays and positions, we can generate one from the other
